MeshLab provides a powerful tool for moving the different meshes into a common reference system, able to manage large set of range-maps. MeshLab implements a fine tuned ICP one-to-one alignment step, followed by a global bundle adjustment error-distribution step. The alignment can be performed on meshes and point clouds coming from several sources, including active (both short- and long-range) scanners and 3D-from-image tools.'

Several automatic and assisted methods are provided to obtain a high quality color encoding, with both per-vertex or texture mapping.'

It is possible to removing topological errors, duplicated and unreferenced vertices, small components, degenerated or intersecting faces, and many more geometrical and topological singularities. Using different automatic and interactive selection methods, is then possible to isolate and remove unwanted areas of your meshes and point clouds.'

MeshLab provides a variety of features to manipulate the scale, positioning and orientation of a 3D model, including basic transformation operations like translation/scaling/rotation, automatic re-centering and alignment to axis, geo-referencing with reference points, interactive manipulators for rotation/translation/scaling, and many others.'

MeshLab offers different ways to simplify (decimate) triangulated surfaces, able to preserve geometrical detail and texture mapping, or to selectively reduce the number of points in a pointcloud. In other cases, the user may want to increase the number of triangles (or points): MeshLab also provides different subdivision schemes, remeshing and resampling filters to increase geometric complexity of 3D models, or to optimize point distribution and triangulation quality.'

Moreover, automatic filters will return various geometric and topological information about your 3D model (or just of a selected area), while the Sectioning tool can export cut-through sections of a mesh as polylines. Different geometric information (like curvature, geodesic distance, or local vertex density) may be calculated on meshes and 3D models using automatic filters.'

Automatic filters are available to calculate Ambient Occlusion and Volumetric Obscurance and map it to vertex or face color. It is also possible to explicitly write color function, to highlight specific characteristics of the 3d model. MeshLab also offer a painting interface for vertex colors. Scalar values, possibly the result of a metric calculation on the 3D surface, may also be mapped on vertex/face color, to have a visual representation of that value.'

Many years ago (in 1997!), the Visual Computing Lab developed and freely distributed what become the standard tool for such task, Metro; the related paper has been cited more than one thousand times, thus demonstrating the impact of that work. While the original Metro tool was still a small open source standalone command line program (still available at our web site), MeshLab offers now much more advanced and versatile functionalities for comparing two meshes, that also compute signed distance and may work on point clouds.'
